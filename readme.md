Sure, here's a shorter version of the "Getting Started with Create React App" section:

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. Here are some available scripts:

* `npm start`: runs the app in development mode. Open <http://localhost:3000> to view it in your browser.
* `npm test`: launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
* `npm run build`: builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
* `npm run eject`: copies all the configuration files and transitive dependencies into your project.

You can learn more about Create React App in the [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
